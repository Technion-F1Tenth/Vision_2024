1. open 2 terminals
2. it the continer terminal:


# run first:
xhost +

# then:
sudo docker run --name object_detection --runtime nvidia -it --rm -v ~/f1tenth_ws:/home/doof-wagon/f1tenth_ws -v ~/Vision_2024:/Vision_2024 --network=f1tenth -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY --privileged --device=/dev f1tenth_object_detection


# If you want to install something in the docker edit docker/Dockerfile and run:
sudo docker build -t f1tenth_object_detection .



____

#inside docker run node:

export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=2
cd /home/doof-wagon/f1tenth_ws/
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run object_detection object_detection_node 

# for the first export command, make sure that 'echo $ROS_DOMAIN_ID' is similar on the host. If not change accordingly
# if host can't see topics published by the container, do the following stupid thing: from the host, publish to a topic:
ros2 topic pub /test_topic std_msgs/msg/String "data: 'Hello from host'"
# and stop it, then you should be able to see containers topics.
